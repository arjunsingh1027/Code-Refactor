# Code-Refactor

For this assignment, we were asked to find repeated code and consolodate it to make the HTML and CSS files more concise. I started by looking at the different html elements and their classes and how they related to the CSS. Once I found the HTML elements with identical and repeated CSS properties, I changed the classes to make the HTML elements pull from one CSS property. 

I was able to remove repeated CSS styles and change the HTML ids to correspond with the CSS.
